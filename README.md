# Next.js Prefetch Bug Demo

A minimal Next.js app demonstrating a bug where prefetched pages trigger an extra network request during navigation, despite the data being preloaded.

## Overview

This demo reproduces a Next.js issue: when a page is prefetched (e.g., on input blur), navigating to it after a server action still triggers a duplicate fetch request. The expected behavior is for navigation to use the prefetched data, avoiding extra requests. A `setTimeout` workaround prevents the issue, suggesting a timing or caching problem in Next.jsâ€™s router.
